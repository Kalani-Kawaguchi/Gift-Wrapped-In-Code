                Merry Christmas Lupita, I want you to know that I love you very much and you are one of the most important people in my life.
                You give me strength to push through when the goin' gets tough.
                You make me feel like everything will be alright no matter how bad things may seem in the moment.
                I know we've had our ups and downs, but I'm glad that those are with you and no one else.
                I want to stay with you through our lowest lows and be there for our highest highs.
                I know you probably think that was corny as fuck for me to say/type but I mean it lol.
            </p>
            <p class="playfair-display">
                I love everything about you, even the parts of you that you might not like about yourself.
                I love your laugh, your smile, your smell, your voice. I love the way you put your foot down 
                when things aren't right. I love that you have a strong will and your perseverance. I love that 
                you push me to do the best I can and keep me accountable for things. I love that the silliest things 
                make you scared, like Temoc. I love the way you're outgoing and social with your friends and family, but 
                get shy around others. I love that you are not afriad to take charge if no one else will. I love how empathetic 
                you are for others. I love that you are so understanding.
            </p>
            <p class="playfair-display">
                I love even the little things about you. I love the way you don't want to kiss if you just ate. 
                I love that you type "ou". I love that you react to my messages with emojis even though I can't see them, 
                I just think it's funny. I love when I take photos of you and you think they all so bad and should never see 
                the light of day, even though those photos are the cutest. I love that you fall asleep so quick given 
                any chance to take a nap. I love your farts, whether it's you farting on me, threatening to fart on me, 
                telling me you farted, or hearing it. I love giving you little Eskimo kisses and eyelash kisses. I love 
                that you like to pick at my chest and back. I love that you will lay down the law if it needs to be done. 
                I love that you make me feel good about myself like when you call me sexy, handsome, when you grab my arms, or 
                even just holding my hand. I love how cool you are and I can confidently say that you are one of the coolest people I know.
            </p>
            <p class="playfair-display">
                I want to work together so that we can both live our best life together for however long that may be. I'm so 
                grateful and happy to have met you and to be able to call you my girlfriend and to be called your boyfriend. 
                I love every second we spend together no matter what it is that we are doing. I look forward to our future together 
                and I will continue to grow and be the best man I can for you and I.
            </p>

                I coded this entire webpage for you as a Christmas present and I hope you like it. I love you so much Lupita, don't 
                ever forget that. When you are ready, go ahead and click the button to see the rest.
