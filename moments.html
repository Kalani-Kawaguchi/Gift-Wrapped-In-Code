                            I loved everything you got me, but I loved the card you wrote me the most. I remember almost crying when I read it, even now I tear up a bit when I read it.

                        <span class="description">Very memorable day. Had my ceremony, you were looking fine as fuck (as always), and I was excited to graduate. We went back to my place and got changed, then 
                            out to eat with my family. We went to round1 and MeowWolf, you found that discount loose change and got us a puzzle. Then we made some sweet love before we said our goodbyes for the holidays.

                            remember. If I forgot anything, it's not because it's not important to me but because there's so much we have done together. I love you Lupita, enjoy the gift :D
